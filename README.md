# Wisconsin Breast Cancer Statistics Project 

The following is the project I presented in my AP Statistics class in which I performed a Wald hypothesis on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. 

## Steps of Analysis


1. Exploratory Data Analysis 
2. Confirmed assumptions and conditions
3. Performed multivariable Wald hypothesis test

## Results 

p-value of roughly 0, less than alpha value of 0.05. 

Sufficient evidence to suggest c(beta) provides a statistically significant association between numerical breast cancer attributes and malignancy status.
